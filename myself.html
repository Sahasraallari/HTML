<h1>Paragraph on Solar System</h1>
<p>The solar system is a collection of celestial bodies, including the Sun, eight planets, their moons, asteroids, comets, and dwarf planets, all gravitationally bound to our Sun. The Sun, a star composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, is the central and most massive object, providing the energy and gravitational force that keeps the system together. The planets, ranging in size from the rocky inner planets like Earth to the gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn, orbit the Sun in elliptical paths. Other smaller bodies, like asteroids and comets, also orbit the Sun, adding to the diverse and fascinating nature of our solar system. </p>
