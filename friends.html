<h1>FRIENDS</h1>
<p style="color: rgb(251, 255, 0);">Friendship is a cornerstone of human connection, a relationship built on mutual respect, trust, and shared experiences. True friends offer support, share laughter, and stand by you through thick and thin. They listen, provide honest advice, and encourage your dreams. Friendships can be found in various forms, from childhood playmates to lifelong companions, and they enrich our lives with joy, belonging, and a sense of understanding.And My Best Friend Nmae is Sehitha </p>
