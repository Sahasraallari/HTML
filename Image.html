<p>The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite, a celestial body that orbits our planet, influencing tides and illuminating the night sky. It's a rocky sphere, reflecting sunlight and exhibiting various phases throughout the month. The Moon's surface is covered in craters, a testament to its history of impacts from asteroids and meteorites. </p>
<p>The solar system is a collection of celestial bodies, primarily the Sun and the eight planets and their moons, asteroids, comets, and other small bodies that orbit it. The Sun, a massive star, is the central and dominant body, and its gravity holds the system together. The eight planets, arranged in a sequence from the Sun, are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. </p>
